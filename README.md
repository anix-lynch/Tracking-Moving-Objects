# 🚗 ObjectTracker: Tracking Moving Objects Using Python

Welcome to **ObjectTracker**! In this project, we’ll build a Python application that detects, tracks, and counts moving objects in video footage. Using OpenCV, we’ll analyze traffic footage to count cars at an intersection, but this same technique can be applied to track any moving objects. Let’s automate the process of video analysis with computer vision! 🎥🚦

## 🌐 Project Overview

Manual analysis of video footage is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With computer vision, we can automate this process, making it easier to extract statistics from videos. In this project, we’ll use Python and OpenCV to detect and track moving objects in videos. Our application will count cars in a traffic video, but the methods learned here can be adapted to other applications, such as tracking animals, people, or objects in different environments.
